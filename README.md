# Traffic Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the average annual daily traffic (AADT) for a section of road or highway. The goal is to understand how the predicors in our dataset influence the AADT and to develop a model that can predict traffic patterns based on these variables.

## Tools and Techniques
- **R**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **dplyr**: Managed and cleaned datasets.
- **ggplot2**: Visualized data and model results.

---

## Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Model Building**: Develop and evaluate statistical models to predict AADT.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare model performance using various metrics.

## Process

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Loaded datasets containing traffic details and related features.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed the distribution of AADT and other features.
   - Visualized relationships between variables.

### 4. **Model Building**
   - Developed statistical models using linear regression.
   - Tuned model parameters to improve performance.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
   - Selected the best model based on performance metrics.

## Results
The results of the analysis and model evaluation are documented in the notebook. Key findings include:
- Identification of significant features influencing AADT.
- Comparison of model performance metrics.
- Recommendations for improving traffic prediction accuracy.
